# Big-Sales-Prediction
Sales Prediction Model
# Description

This project implements a machine learning model to predict sales based on various features using a dataset from the YBI Foundation. The model uses a Random Forest Regressor to analyze and make predictions.
# Dataset

The dataset is sourced from YBI Foundation and contains various features related to sales. The specific columns are analyzed and processed to build the predictive model.
# Dependencies

    pandas
    numpy
    matplotlib
    seaborn
    scikit-learn

You can install the required packages using:

bash

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

Installation

    Clone the repository:

    bash

git clone <repository-url>

Navigate to the project directory:

bash

    cd <project-directory>

Usage

Run the script to load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance:

bash

python sales_prediction.py

# File Description

    sales_prediction.py: The main script that contains the code for data loading, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.

# Modeling

The project utilizes a RandomForestRegressor from scikit-learn. The model is trained on 80% of the dataset and tested on the remaining 20%.
# Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE). The lower the MSE, the better the model's performance.
# Results

The Mean Squared Error of the model predictions will be printed after the evaluation step, along with the predictions for the test dataset.
